# ‚öôÔ∏è IDE

JetBrains IDEs store their settings in version-specific directories. Check which IDE versions are installed with the following command.

```shell
ls ~/Library/Application\ Support/JetBrains/
```

<br/>

For example, if you are using IntelliJ IDEA 2025.1, you can check the keymap, codestyles, templates configuration files as follows.

```shell
# keymap
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/JetBrains/IntelliJIdea2025.1/keymaps/macOS\ copy.xml
```

```shell
# codestyles
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/JetBrains/IntelliJIdea2025.1/codestyles/Default.xml
```

```shell
# templates 
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/JetBrains/IntelliJIdea2025.1/templates/Java.xml
```
